# Biography :memo:

Konichiwa! My name is Walter Báez Laguna and I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. 
I major in Computer Sciences and also cheer for the Cheerleading Team at the Campus. My short term goal is to finsih my career with the
neccesary tools and accomplishments to suffice my future company or corporation. Currently, I'm still quite a novice but I'm working
to change that with the learning experience I get from my classes and my new investigation using Stack to find SNPs in RADSeq. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ 

## Hobbies :space_invader:
- I love video games! All different kinds, from MOBAs to Shooters, RPGs and MMOs, everything honestly. :video_game:
- I'm also an anime and manga fan. :octocat:
- Sleep and eating should count as hobbies. :pizza:
- Some sports are fun to do like swimming, volleyball and of course Cheerleading. :swimmer:
- Science Fiction and Fantasy books are life to me :books:
- Last but not least spend some time browsing the internet finding new projects and interesting codes. :ghost:

# Weekly Updates :date:
## Week 5 (30th of September, 2016 to 7th of October, 2016) :clock:
- We been running the denovo_map.pl script with different parameters, we been using new Data Bases, new foulders with the data and we are   still getting the same issue. We dont know why it's not building some of the files. It can't find the files XXX.batch_catalog.tags.tsv 
  and the XXX.matches.tsv fails obviously because it can't build the catalog right and it doesn't load the output. 

## Week 5 (23th of September, 2016 to 30th of September, 2016) :clock:
- The problem with the Data Bases lasted until this week. First it wasn't really building the catalog because it has no space. 
- After we fixed that we then had problems with the uploading again but that was easily fixed with the administrator this time. 
- Now the new problem is that it's building some catalogs and files but it's missing some. 

## Week 4 (16th of September, 2016 to 23th of September, 2016) :clock:
- This week there was a blackout and a bunch of things in college so we couldn't really work much but we started getting erros when we 
  tried to build the denovo_map.pl. Basically, it was a problem with the coverage (we were getting nothing from the files), the Web Server   and the Data Bases. We asked the administrator for
  assistance and tried to do a bunch of things but with was all administrator level.

## Week 3 (9th of September, 2016 to 16th of September, 2016) :clock:
- Since we don't have a reference genome it was hard to decided what we will do with the data, what parameters to use and how to actually 
  run things since the Stacks Manual talks about building the next steps with a reference genome.
- After reading and concluding what was best for our first attempt on building the denovo_map.pl we encounter a few errors. The script    
  itself was very easy to do since Stacks parameters are easy to understand but depending on which numbers you acutally use the catalog   
  changes and that's where the trick is at.

## Week 2 (2nd of September, 2016 to 9th of September, 2016) :clock1:
- Started working on the lab finally!
- I managed to start working with Stacks, grasoing what each parameter does and trying to see what steps to take to clean the data.
- We uploaded the files to Makaira and started working building the FASTQC files of each raw data to see how it looked like.
- We didn't know if Stacks cleaned and trimmed the bad reads so we read more information about the manual and started noticed it did.
- After we cleaned the files and trimmed the bad reads it was time to start our next script for the denovo_map.pl. 

## Week 1 (21fst of August, 2016 to 2nd of September, 2016) :clock1:
- Arrieved at the lab, met the professors and received my instructions.
- Read the Stack presentation and manual given to me at the lab.
- Waiting on the RADSeq data that hasn't arrived and on more instructions.
- There was no one on the lab (Sept. 2nd) because they went fishing for more research individuals 
  so I went and did my hours creating my GitHub and setting up my Weekly Reports.
